You slowly open your eyes, feeling the effects of the copious amounts of alcohol you drank the night prior.
You vaguely remember something about getting clapped in pickleball by Anthony. It's all coming back now, that was the 
motivation for said heavy drinking. As you awaken, you recall that shortly after finishing the rust book, you decided that 
you would dedicate your life to rewriting the world in rust. You vowed to guide the software world into a brighter future
no matter who stands in your way. Safe, fast, productive. Pick three.
As you stand to your feet, you hear a familiar voice.
